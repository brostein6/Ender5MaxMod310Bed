# Intro
Tcosta produced this Mercury One.1 Mod based on another modified Ender 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWwZJeksejw&ab_channel=vedanthinorn
This repo is just a community page to share this modification and make it easier for everyone to follow.

# Requirements:
Dual-z: second motor, or belted lead screw to support 310 bed
Bed Frame: second Ender 5 bed frame or custom setup (example pictured)

# Easy Build:
2040 extrusions

# Material choice:
ASA: Orient all parts close together with brims. This will promote adheison and decrease chances of layer separation. I was able to print everything on one plate without an enclosure
stepper mounts, tension towers, gantry mounts
PLA: 
risers, cable chain/guide, MGN9 guide, 2020 spacer, guide rod brackets
